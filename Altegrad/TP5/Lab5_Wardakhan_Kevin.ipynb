In black-box distillation, the student only sees the teacher’s outputs as plain generated answers or labels, without access to token-level probabilities or internal states. This is very flexible and works with external APIs, but the information is limited and the student often learns a poorer approximation. In white-box distillation, the teacher is available locally and we can at least access its log-probabilities over the vocabulary at each step, and possibly its internal representations. This richer access usually gives better performance and more sample efficient training, but it requires full access to the teacher model and is less flexible than the black-box setting.<hr style=\"border:10px solid green\"> </hr>\n",

In option 2 (offline distillation), we first pay a one-time cost to generate answers and log-probabilities with the teacher, then we can train the student many times on this fixed dataset.

        "Since we only have the top-20 logprobs, we can approximate full distillation in two main ways. First, we can exponentiate and renormalize the top-20 probabilities so that they sum to 1 and compute the distillation loss (for example a KL divergence) only on these 20 tokens, assuming most of the probability mass is in this set. Second, we can keep the top-20 probabilities as they are and create an additional “other tokens” bucket with probability equal to 1 minus the sum of the top-20. For the student, we then sum its probabilities over all non-top-20 tokens into the same “other” bucket and compute the KL on this 21-dimensional distribution, which better accounts for the teacher’s remaining probability mass.<hr style=\"border:10px solid green\"> </hr>\n",

This strongly penalizes the student when it assigns very low probability to tokens that the teacher considers likely, but is less sensitive if the student puts some extra mass where the teacher’s probability is small. As a result, the student tends to cover all modes of the teacher and converge to a smoother, more “spread out” approximation of $P_T$.\n",

It sometimes works reasonably well, but it breaks in many common cases such as abbreviations (\"Dr.\", \"e.g.\"), numbers (\"3.14\"), or missing punctuation, and it ignores higher level structure like paragraphs, headings, and lists. For a RAG system, this can lead to chunks that cut important sentences in awkward places or separate sentences that belong together, which harms retrieval quality and answer coherence.\n",

They are very precise when the query shares words with the document, but they fail when the query uses different wording or synonyms. Dense embedding methods instead encode queries and documents into continuous vectors using a neural model, and compare them with cosine or dot-product similarity; this captures semantic similarity beyond exact matches, but can miss very specific keywords or be sensitive to embedding noise.  \n",

This way, lexical retrieval ensures that highly specific, keyword-heavy documents are not missed, while dense retrieval surfaces semantically related content even when there is little lexical overlap. In RAG systems, such a hybrid approach usually improves recall and robustness, leading to better grounded and more relevant generated answers.\n"

        "HNSW organizes vectors into a multi-layer graph where upper layers are very sparse and contain long-range links, and lower layers are denser and capture local neighbors. Each node belongs to one or more layers, and edges connect it to a small set of nearby points. To search, the algorithm starts from an entry point in the top layer and performs a greedy walk that moves to neighbors that are closer to the query. Once no closer neighbor can be found, it descends to the next layer and repeats, until it reaches the bottom layer where it refines the search and collects the nearest neighbors.  \n",
        "\n",
        "This hierarchical small-world structure is effective because it combines long-range jumps, which quickly bring the search into the right region of the space, with dense local connectivity for accurate refinement. As a result, HNSW achieves high recall with a search cost that grows roughly logarithmically with the number of points, instead of linearly as in brute-force search. This makes it particularly suitable for large-scale embedding collections in RAG systems, where millions of high-dimensional vectors must be searched with low latency.\n"

In a Cross-Encoder, the query and document are concatenated and passed together through a single transformer, so every query token can attend to every document token. This joint encoding lets the model capture fine-grained interactions, exact term alignments, and nuanced semantic relationships, which typically yields much higher precision for relevance scoring.  \n",

        "In our current RAG setup, we simply concatenate all retrieved chunks before the user question. This naive approach can cause several issues: it may hit the model’s token limit and truncate useful context, include redundant or highly overlapping chunks, and dilute the relevant information with partially relevant or irrelevant passages. As a result, the model has to “search” inside a long noisy prompt, which can hurt answer quality and increase computation cost.\n",
        "\n",
        "To improve this, we could first rank the retrieved chunks by their similarity score and keep only the top few, or downweight/remove near-duplicate chunks using a secondary similarity check between chunks.  \n",
        "We can also score chunks by both similarity and recency or source quality, and choose a diverse set rather than many very similar passages. Another option is to summarize or compress the top-k chunks into a shorter synthetic context (for example with a small summarization model) before injecting it into the prompt.  \n",
        "\n",
        "These strategies help stay within token limits, reduce redundancy, and provide a more focused and informative context, which usually leads to better and more efficient generation.\n"
